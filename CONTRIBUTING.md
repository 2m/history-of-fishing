## Generating native-image configuration

The `native-image` reflection configuration file [reflect-config.json][] is generated by attaching `native-image-agent` to the JVM process that runs typical `hof` workload.

To regenerate reflection configuration:

1. Run typical `hof` workload with attached agent:

    ```sbt
    sbt> nativeImageRunAgent " resolve-conflicts"
    ```

1. Regenerate native image with updated configuration:

    ```shell
    sbt> nativeImage
    ```
